# Loop structure: while, do-while

## while loop

The while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as the condition is true.

```c
while (condition)
{
    // code block to be executed
}
```

The condition is evaluated before executing the code block. If the condition is true, the code block will be executed. This process will continue until the condition becomes false.

## do-while loop

The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but the condition is evaluated after executing the code block.

```c

do
{
    // code block to be executed
} while (condition);
```

The code block will be executed at least once, even if the condition is false.
